## Scope of the Submodel 

The submodels defined in this document describe the integration of PEA (instance) 
and MTP (type) information into an AAS. The models do not intend to cover asset 
aspects addressed by further submodel definitions like technical data [8] or 
digital nameplate. Therefore, introduced models should be used along with 
mentioned ones to complete the AAS of the respective asset.
