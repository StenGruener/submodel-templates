## Scope of the Submodel 

"In the context of Industrie 4.0, software as an asset becomes increasingly important. For an effective and efficient use and management of software in manufacturing value networks, in smart manufacturing, and in smart products, it is necessary to gather relevant information in a uniform representation, as a “nameplate for software”. This supports use cases like updates, patch management, license management, audits, etc. 
This Submodel template specifies a basic set of SubmodelElements in order to describe the necessary information."
