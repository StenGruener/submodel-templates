# Carbon Footprint (Version 1.0)

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

"This Submodel template provides the means to exchange an asset`s Carbon Footprint (CF) between the partners along a value chain. The aim of this Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the parties, who are interested in documenting, exchanging, evaluating or optimizing the environmental footprint of their assets. These parties can for example be manufacturers, users/consumers or logistic partners. The CF might be part of larger initiatives such as the Digital Product Passport or the Product Environmental Footprint. It is not the scope of this Submodel template to provide the details of the CF-calulation and it does not substitute the relevant certificates."
