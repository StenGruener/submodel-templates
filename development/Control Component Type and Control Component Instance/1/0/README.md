## Scope of the Submodel 

"Actuators, sensors and their composition into operating equipment for industrial production usually require automated guidance. The associated control functionality can be encapsulated in components. These control components show similar interfaces to the outside across different application domains and hierarchy levels and similar behavior when interacting with these interfaces.

The ControlComponentType and ControlComponentInstance submodels enable a simple, uniform description of these components for their use in or for setting up process control (orchestration). Therefore they describe mainly
– which interfaces are available and how they can be reached,
– which modes (operation modes, services, procedures, skills, depending on the context) the components offer at the interface
– and which errors can occur in these modes.

The submodels thus make it possible in the future to compile the operating modes of the leading components according to different standards (e.g. a mixing service in an MTP module and the filling of a PackML machine) in engineering to form a machine-supported sequence or to assign these to required capabilities in the sequence. In doing so, the driving modes can be semantically annotated via additional capabilities submodels. At the same time, the compensation of errors and the establishment of communication links can be provided for. Finally, the sequences can be implemented automatically in the plant."
